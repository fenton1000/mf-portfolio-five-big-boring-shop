# Portfolio Project 5 - Big Boring Shop README

## 1. Purpose of the Project

Big Boring Shop intends to establish itself as an online grocery store. Its stated aim is to compete with low-cost grocery retailers but in the form of a fully online service including delivery with no high street presence. The lack of a high street presence is a deliberate part of the business model, with the aim of eliminating the high costs associated with this form of retail. Instead a warehouse and delivery system will form the key business infrastructure.

Furthermore, with a view to providing a competive service the store will focus on a narrow selection of popular, high volume, day to day household goods and foods. Niche products will not form part of the offering.

In terms of the marketing of the business the intention is to be quite upfront about the model. The business will be saying to customers that the big weekly shop to buy the usual essentials is also the big, time consuming, not so exciting weekly chore - the Big Boring Shop! So why not spend your precious time doing something a bit more exciting, maybe some proper retail therapy, and let us look after the boring stuff! We will even deliver to your door.

As the model relies entirely on an online presence, the need for a simple easy to use website and payment system together with a comprehensive web marketing strategy is clear.
